# Computer Intake Protocol

*A Rocker with a computer problem who must leave their computer with ITS to repair? <br />
Just follow this guide and all will be well!*


**If a computer comes in with a problem that you cannot fix during your shift,** [create an RT ticket](https://rt.simons-rock.edu). Doing so will help keep others informed of the issues and will help ITS to ensure that user problems are being adequately addressed.

When creating a ticket, be sure to mind the following:

1. Ensure that the subject line of the ticket contains meaningful and descriptive information. For example, writing just “computer problem” doesn’t provide much useful information, whereas “screen flickering on Lenovo X1 Carbon” does.
2. Select the appropriate queue, i.e. ‘Help Desk’ for help requests received at ITS and ‘Library’ for any issue or questions received during a library shift.
3. Explain the problem in detail in the content box. Be sure to include: 
  + Make and model of the computer.
  + Name and email address of the person coming in with the problem.
  + More explicit and articulate description of the issues. What are the symptoms (slow computer, will not boot, a particular error message)?  When did the problems start? What was the user doing when the problem started.
4. After entering all pertinent information in RT, press ‘Create’ to send the ticket to the queue (see picture below).




**Be certain to ask the user if their computer is password protected.** If it is, record the username and password on a Post-It note and place the note on the keyboard of the computer (assuming it is a laptop) or otherwise in an inconspicuous place. *Do not input this information on RT.* 

At the start of your shift, please also remember to check the Current Help Desk Tickets to see if there are any tickets that you can help resolve.

*Thanks!*
