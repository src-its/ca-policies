## Promoting Awareness of CA Presence at SRC.

### Context

CAs have pointed out that the SRC student body is not very aware that Computer Assistants are available to help with technology-related issues.  Most CAs see little activity at the CA table in the Alumni Library [for which we've created the handle `@theCAtable`].

CAs also note that while posters that display specific CA Table themes may attract some students to engage CAs in conversation or for support, themes advertisements are not effective in conveying the broader message that the CAs are a general resource that are aways available.

This discussion aims to help generate ideas for better informing the SRC student body of CA availability.


### Avenues for Increasing Awareness of CA Availability

Suggestions for raising awareness of SRC CA Availability for after-hours support in the Alumni Library include:

* advertise `@theCAtable` as a program (in addition to advertising individual CA library themes)
    * post regular, once-per-week advertisements of the program in general to  the ['student announce'](mailto:student@simons-rock.edu) emails list
    * post a repeating announcement of the `@theCAtable` program to the [weekly events calendar](http://simons-rock.edu/events/index.php?com=submit)
    * make posters that advertise the program as a whole
        * consider posting on doors to the library, on the bulletin board in the dining hall, and at the Student Union
* ask professors to help promote the program in class&mdash;especially for shifts that relate to their course (for example, but advertising sessions about learning R during 'Intro to Stats') 
   - note that some CAs have proposed to create a list of courses that use special software or programs and to direct announcements for relevant tutorials to those classes / professors
* add an announcement to the front page of the SRC portal (my.simons-rock.edu)
* ask RDs to help raise awareness of `@thCAtable` during house meetings
* explore the possibility of getting ACE credits for attending (or hosting) a library shift
