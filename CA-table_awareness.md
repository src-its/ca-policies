## Promoting Awareness of CA Presence at SRC.

**Context:**

CAs have pointed out that the SRC student body is not very aware that Computer Assistants are available to help with technology-related issues.  Most CAs see little activity @theCAtable.

CAs also note that while posters display specific CA Table themes may attract some students to engage CAs in conversation or for support, they are not effective in conveying the broader message that the CAs are a general resource that are aways available.

This discussion aims to help generate ideas for better informing the SRC student body CA availability.

**Avenues for increasing awareness include:**

* advertise the @theCAtable as a program (in addition to advertising individual CA library themes)
    * advertisements could be via the student announcement emails list
* put up more posters
* ask professors to help promote the program in class&mdash;especially for shifts that relate to their course
* add an alert to the SRC website (my.simons-rock.edu)
